Dependencies
---------------

To run the vortex-ishapes demo you simply need to have a JDK or JRE --
ideally v1.7 or higher.

If you don't have a JDK/JRE installed, please get one from:

   http://java.oracle.com



Running the Demo
----------------

Running the demo is very simple, on windows do: 

c:\some\path\vortex-shapes:> ishapes.bat somebody@company.com

On Unix derivatives (Linux, MacOS, Solaris, etc.), do:

$ ./ishapes somebody@company.com

This command will start the ishapes application using your email as
the partition used to produce and consume data. If you want to play
with the web demo (http://demo.prismtech.com:9000), ensure that you
use the same email address for both demo.

You can start multiple instances of the demo, publish and subscribe to
different shapes across applications running on the JVM, the Web
Browser as well as Android.
